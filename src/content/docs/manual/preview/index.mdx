When editing notes and events in the other views, it can be hard to get a sense for what the final product will be like in-game.
While there is no substitute for loading up the game in VR and playtesting the map for yourself, the "Preview" view will try to come as close as possible. 

This view will showcase all of your lighting events in action, as well as objects spawning in a fashion similar to the game, taking things like Note Jump Speed and Start Beat Offset into account.

While it will never be a perfect 1-to-1 recreation, since there's obviously limitations in terms of graphical capabilities on web environments, 
the aim is to give you a decent enough visualization of how all of the components in your map come together and give you more confidence in the end result.
