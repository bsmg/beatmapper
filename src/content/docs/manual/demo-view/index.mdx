While editing notes and events in the previous two views, it can be hard to get a sense for what the final product is like, how the map will play.

While there is no substitute for trying your map in-game, I'm currently working on a new view that will come as close as possible. This view will showcase all of your lighting and ring events, as well as feature blocks spawning in a fashion similar to the game, taking things like Note Jump Speed and Start Beat Offset into account.

This is an ambitious feature, and my time is limited, so it may be a while. A super-early preview is available, with support for some events:

<video src='./videos/demo-preview.mp4' autoPlay muted loop controls style={{ width: '100%' }}/>

> WARNING: This video features flashing, strobing lights.
