Many online web services transmit the files you select to be stored in a remote server. 
The owner of that remote server then bears certain responsibilities around managing the content and ensuring that all respective laws and regulations are followed 
(especially those pertaining to copyright and piracy).

Beatmapper runs entirely on your device: there is no remote storage mechanism. 
When you select files on your computer (like the `.ogg` song file, or `.jpg` cover art image), your browser is responsible for processing those files on-device and storing them within the browser's memory.

Put simply, the files you select are never transmitted over a network. This means that Beatmapper does not receive them, nor are we able to "block" or "delete" copyrighted materials. 
Beatmapper is akin to an audio editing program, like Audacity or Adobe Audition, in how it functions.

The one exception to this policy is the demo track, Only Now by Geoxor. 
The song is released as public domain, and the map files are stored within the source code and served like any other assets (like fonts and images).
