Beatmapper is proud to be minimally invasive from a privacy standpoint. We collect very little information, and operate in a manner similar to a desktop standalone application.

This document covers the data we collect and how we use it.

## Remotely collected data

All services within Beatmapper operate entirely on-device, and we do not own or operate any remote services outside of the single-page web application distributed via GitHub Pages.

- Beatmapper does not feature a user authentication system; as such, we do not handle any personally-identifiable information (PII).
- Beatmapper does not feature any client-side analytics; we don't use Google Analytics or any similar services.
- Beatmapper does not feature any mechanisms to process or store your data on any remote servers or cloud platforms.

In the future I may wish to collect aggregate analytics to improve the editor. 
For example, one of the editor controls allows users to increase/decrease the spacing between notes. 
I have no idea how many people use this feature. If the answer is near-zero, it probably makes sense to remove it, and replace it with something more useful.

## Locally saved data

Beatmapper doesn't use any cookies, but we do use other browser storage mechanisms provided by Web APIs: 

- **[IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)** is used for local file storage of related map files, such as audio/image assets and serial map data.
- **[Web Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)** is used for storing persistable application state so that settings can be "sticky". 
  For example, if you update the render scale, your browser will remember that setting and restore that value tomorrow.

These APIs live entirely within the browser, and all data you provide to the application is solely and exclusively stored on your device.
