subtitle: Important differences compared to other editors
---

If you're familiar with another editor like MediocreMapper, Beatmapper might seem weird or counter-intuitive. 
I started from scratch with the design, after finding myself frustrated with the editing experience in existing editors.

This document exists to highlight some of the differences, and justify why I feel it's worth deviating from the established convention.

## Dedicated Views

In MediocreMapper and other editors, both notes and events are edited in the same screen, and previewed at the same time. In Beatmapper, there are 3 separate views:

- A "Beatmap" view for editing blocks, mines, and obstacles
- A "Lightshow" view for editing lights and ring events
- A "Preview" view that tries to accurately show what your notes and events look like (still under construction / doesn't really exist yet)

I think that there are advantages to having a dedicated events view, but I'll readily admit that it's not ideal to have the context switching as you tab between views. The main reason for this is around performance - as a web application, Beatmapper incurs a performance penalty, and having everything run at once can drain resources. I have some ideas around how to address this in the future, but it's unavoidable for now.

For what it's worth, I haven't heard any complaints about this.

## Movement in Space

In other mappers, you hold right-click to enable WASD movement, and use shift/space to float up/down. In Beatmapper, you hold `Shift` to enable WASD movement, and use the keys `R` and `F` to rise and fall.

There are two main reasons for this change:

- I wanted to use right-click to delete blocks. Left-click-to-add, right-click-to-remove is a common convention in many programs, and I think it adds a lot of value here.
- If you wish to add notes while enabling camera movement, you need to hold right click while pressing left-click, an action that is not possible on all mice (eg. Magic Mouse). 
By using `Shift` to control WASD movement, there is no conflict.

## Unique Event Workflow

In other editors, lighting/events are made to work as similar as possible to notes. It's presented as a parallel track, with similar blocks used to represent events.

Beatmapper opts for a special UI for editing events, described in our ["Lightshow" view](/docs/events-view) documentation. This offers many advantages:

- For high-energy songs, it's common to want to "strobe" lights, having on/off moving quickly (as fast as 1/32 beat!). With chunky blocks, it's impossible to understand information presented this quickly. Beatmapper displays it clearly no matter how quickly you want events to hit
- Unlike the notes themselves, which exist and move in 3D space, events can easily be represented as 2D data. By having a "grid" representing lighting, you get all kinds of UX wins, such as the ability to quickly select subsets of the data, not having perspective getting in the way, etc. I've taken inspiration from MIDI piano rolls.
- Two tracks are unlike the others: left laser speed, and right laser speed. These don't trigger new events, they change the speed of other events. I've come up with a custom UI that shows how laser speed changes in a visually significant way. With numbered blocks, a lot more processing is involved to understand how the speed changes over time.
- Lights are not always single moments in time; "on" and "flash" leave the light on, while "off" and "fade" turn it off. By using colored backgrounds, I'm able to convey at a glance whether the track is on or off at any moment in time.

The TL:DR; of this is that while the events view may seem foreign, I strongly believe that it offers a lot of compelling advantages.

## Sharable Lightshow Contents

For community editors (and certain legacy map formats), every beatmap has its own dedicated set of lighting events. 
When you change beatmaps, you get a totally blank slate, and need to create both the notes/obstacles _and_ the lighting events.

Older versions of Beatmapper were configured to use one set of lighting events for every beatmap. 
This ended up being a nice quality-of-life feature to prevent the user from needing to manually copy over the lighting events for each beatmap.
However, this ended up causing incompatibilities with certain mapsets that *did* implement unique lightshows for each beatmap, 
as Beatmapper would only pull events from the first beatmap.

The latest version of Beatmapper aims to provide a nice compromise for both cases by appending a "Lightshow ID" to each beatmap, 
which alters the behavior of how lightshow data is stored and processed across the beatmaps:

- Any newly created maps will have a standalone lightshow by default (the Lightshow ID will share the same name as the Beatmap ID by default).
- For maps that are imported into the editor, their lightshows will be parsed based on the behavior of their implicit map format.
  This means v2 and v3 beatmaps will be configured with unique lightshows, while v4 maps will read the lightshow filenames to determine how lightshows should be assigned.
- When you save changes to a lightshow for one beatmap, those changes will be applied to all beatmaps that share the same Lightshow ID automatically.

> Keep in mind that changes are automatically saved when downloading a map, switching the selected beatmap, or leaving an editor view.

This new architecture gives the user much more agency in how lightshow contents are shared across the beatmaps, 
and allows both lightshow behaviors to co-exist without creating awkward conflicts or incompatibilities as you move between editors and map formats.

## Compatibility

Some beatmap features have limited compatibility in the editor, or offer no compatbility at all. This will give you a rundown of what to expect if you're working with unsupported data.

### Arcs/Chains: *Unsupported*

The systems for these features haven't been implemented yet. 
Many systems were rearchitected in anticipation of these features during the rewrite, but it'll take some time before they're ready to land.

### BPM Changes: *Unsupported*

Beatmapper does not yet support a proper timescale for adjusting the tick rate of playback based on variable regions. 
This is a pretty high priority feature, but it'll take a lot of prototyping and iteration to get right, 
especially since there are two systems for calculating BPM changes that don't quite mesh with one another. ðŸ™ƒ

### NJS Events: *Unsupported*

Similarly to the above, a proper timescale would need to be implemented for adjusting the jump speed of objects based on variable regions. 

### Transition Events: *Partial Implementation*

You can import maps with transition events just fine, but they are intentionally not editable by default.

This is because transition events require a proper timescale system to be implemented for simulating lightshow effects, which Beatmapper currently does not have an implementation for.

### Boost Events: *Unsupported*

The systems for these features haven't been implemented yet. 
Many systems were rearchitected in anticipation of these features during the rewrite, but it'll take some time before they're ready to land.

### Rotation Events: *Not Planned*

The systems for these features haven't been implemented yet. 
Ideally I'd like to design a more intuitive workflow for rotation events, since ChroMapper's workflow for tracking rotations can be a bit disorienting to manage if you're not used to it, 
but it's so low priority compared to other features we have on the backlog, and there's a strong change it might be made irrelevant when the official editor workflow lands in a future game update.

Chances are very likely we'll be passing on this feature, but hard to say for sure.

### Environment Visualizations: *Not Planned*

Systematically, we would not be equipped to remake over 40+ environments *from scratch* with all of their associated lighting mechanics with reasonable accuracy to the base game, 
since the translation layer between Unity and Three.js is not necessarily the most straightforward thing to implement.
Couple that with the ceiling of computing power and graphics processing capabilities that we have with the web environment, it's just not worth the hassle.

Put simply, you're better off using the official editor if you want accurate environment visualizations, 
as you really can't get any better than what is literally a 1-to-1 recreation taken straight from the assets within the base game.

### Event Box Groups: *Not Planned*

This is a very complex system to implement due to the sheer amount of nesting and visualization required for accuracy of effects, 
and considering that accurate environment visualizations are already out-of-scope for this editor, I wouldn't count on this landing anytime soon.

Once again, you're probably better off using the official editor anyway since their workflow for event boxes is much more manageable and intuitive than what community editors can offer at the moment.

### Heck Suite (Chroma, Noodle Extensions, Vivify): *Not Planned*

Many of these mods take advantage of overriding the base game's internal processes and shaders and giving maps granular control of these systems, 
which Beatmapper can't really support for very obvious reasons (web vs. unity).

ChroMapper is much better equipped to handle these systems, 
as it was originally architected with support for these systems in mind and can leverage more parity with these systems thanks to being built on top of the same engine as Beat Saber itself.
