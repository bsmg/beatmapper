**Beatmapper** is a web-based level editor for Beat Saber‚Ñ¢. It lets you create your own "beatmaps" to be used in-game for your favorite songs.

As of now, the editor is in an **alpha** stage; most of the core functionality is in, but you should expect the occasional bug or two.
Even so, mappers of all skill levels have been able to use it to create high-quality maps.

## Features

- üíª **Cross-platform support**. Beatmapper works on any platform with a web browser, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The editor is also distributed as a standalone PWA with offline capabilities.
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Low-friction**. Beatmapper aims to let you get started in seconds. No big download, no installing anything. It even comes with a demo map to help you learn the editor.
- ‚úÖ **Focus on user experience (UX).** Beatmapper will never be as feature-rich as other editors, but my hope is that it can offer a great experience in terms of usability.
  The goal is to create an editor you enjoy using, one that doesn't frustrate you or get in your way.
  This is done through an intuitive UI, good documentation, and thoughtful quality-of-life features.
