title: Frequently Asked Questions
---

We've received a lot of questions around Beatmapper over the years. Here are the more important ones you should probably know the answers to:

## Is the editor actively maintained?

Yes! I ([officialMECH](https://github.com/officialmech)) am the sole maintainer and will be periodically updating the editor with new quality-of-life features and bugfixes. 
However, I work on this project during my free time, so new features might take substantially longer than other editors since my time and attention is limited.

## Can I help contribute to Beatmapper?

Absolutely! The editor is [open-source](https://github.com/bsmg/beatmapper) and MIT-licensed, so regardless of how much programming experience you have, 
you're welcome to read through the [Contributor's Guide](https://github.com/bsmg/beatmapper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you'd like to help with future development.

## Where is the best place to report bugs / request features?

All user reports are tracked on the [Issues tab of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/bsmg/beatmapper/issues).
That way, you won't have to scavenge around Discord channels and other feeds to find out whether you're bug/feature has been reported or addressed, 
and any additional context or updates can be provided in the thread for each report when new developments or updates are available.

## How can I test upcoming features?

We don't support a "dev" branch of Beatmapper to preview upcoming builds like with other community editors, 
since there is no remote storage mechanism, and local data cannot be easily transferrable across devices or instances (due to various limitations on web platforms).

However, you can always [build a local instance of the editor](/docs/running-locally) off any `staging/*` branch to test an upcoming build of Beatmapper direct from the repository.
Just be aware that by doing so, **you will not be guaranteed support if you encounter unexpected issues**, since these builds are not guaranteed to be stable in the first place.

## When are we getting support for [INSERT FEATURE HERE]?

Beatmapper is primarily developed by a sole maintainer with limited free time and resources, 
and it takes a lot of work in order to bring a 5+ year old editor back up to speed with the modern featureset of the game. 

You can always monitor the progress of upcoming features via the [Milestones](https://github.com/bsmg/beatmapper/milestones) tab. 
A [compatibility guide](/docs/migration#compatibility) is also available that outlines what newer beatmap features are planned and/or supported by the editor for the current update, 
but please be patient since there is still a lot of work to be done to ensure full compatibility, and it will not happen overnight.

## Are there plans to improve mobile support?

While Beatmapper's current architecture creates a path forward for having a viable mobile editor within the ecosystem, 
there are still a considerable number of roadblocks that make it very difficult to fully pursue:

- Because Beatmapper does not have a remote storage layer or directory mounting mechanism, all maps must be manually transferred between desktop and mobile devices, 
  which ends up being a pretty significant inconvenience when needing to preview your maps in-game.
- Some platforms may have reduced support for architectures/frameworks used to provide core functionality. 
  For example, iOS devices will refuse to process blobs/files in "private browsing" modes, which completely breaks processing workflows for the storage layer and editor views.
- Some platforms may automatically delete locally-stored data after periods of inactivity, 
  which destroys the whole intent of the local storage mechanism acting as the app's persistence layer.

On top of these roadblocks, we would need to create an entirely new workflow for the editor view that would work for mobile devices, 
and create a unified architecture and workflow that can be shared across desktop and mobile environments.
This is a considerable amount of work for what I would consider to be very little payoff, hence why it's not in strong consideration at this time.
