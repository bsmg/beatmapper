title: Welcome Back!

It's been a while since our last update. 
Here's a quick refresher on the current state of the editor:

- Beatmapper is *alpha* software. That means things can spontaneously combust at any moment. Make sure to keep frequent backups of your maps using <Key><MetaKey /></Key>+<Key>S</Key>.
- We have really thorough docs! Please [check them out](https://beatmapper.app/docs), since they will probably answer a good majority of the questions you might have.
- Beatmapper is open-source!  Contributions are welcome if you know what your doing, so check out [the repository](https://github.com/bsmg/beatmapper) if you're interested.
