**Beatmapper** is a web-based level editor for Beat Saberâ„¢. It lets you create your own "beatmaps" to be used in-game for your favorite songs.

## Getting Started

Beatmapper works entirely in the browser; there is nothing to download, nor is there a backend. You can get started now at https://beatmapper.app. 

User documentation is available at https://beatmapper.app/docs.

Beatmapper is also fully open-source and [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md), and all contributions are welcome regardless of programming experience. 
If you're interested in helping with ongoing development, you can read through the [Contributor's Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) 
to learn more about the project and its associated technologies.

## Why?

There are many superior editors available for mapping nowadays, including the official editor. Here are some reasons why you may want to use this one:

- Works on any platform with a web browser (including Windows, Mac, and Linux).
- Requires about 1 MB of total download including assets.
- Comes with a demo track, so you can start playing around immediately.

That said, there's many capabilities other editors have that Beatmapper can't and likely won't be able to support. 
If that's a dealbreaker for you, we recommend using a more sophisticated editor like [ChroMapper](https://github.com/Caeden117/ChroMapper) or the official level editor.
