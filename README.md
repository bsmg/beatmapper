Beatmapper is a web-based _level editor_ for Beat Saber.

## Getting Started

Beatmapper works entirely in the browser; there is nothing to download, nor is there a backend. You can get started now at https://beatmapper.app. On your first visit, you'll be able to play around with a demo map to get a feel for the editor.

Documentation is available at https://beatmapper.app/docs.

## Why?

There are many superior editors available for mapping nowadays, including the official editor. Here are some reasons why you may want to use this one:

- Works on any platform with a web browser (including Windows, Mac, and Linux).
- Requires about 1 MB of total download including assets.
- Comes with a demo track, so you can start playing around immediately.

That said, there's many capabilities other editors have that Beatmapper can't and likely won't be able to support. If that's a dealbreaker for you, we recommend using a more feature-rich editor like [ChroMapper](https://github.com/Caeden117/ChroMapper) or the official editor for a better experience.
